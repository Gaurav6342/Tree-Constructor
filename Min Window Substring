Have the function MinWindowSubstring(strArr) take the 
array of strings stored in strArr, which will contain only two strings, 
the first parameter being the string N and the second parameter being a string K of some characters, 
and your goal is to determine the smallest substring of N that contains all the characters in K. For example: if strArr is ["aaabaaddae", "aed"] then the smallest substring of N that contains the characters a, e, and d is "dae" located at the end of the string. So for this example your program should return the string dae.

Another example: if strArr is ["aabdccdbcacd", "aad"] then 
the smallest substring of N that contains all of the characters in K is
"aabd" which is located at the beginning of the string. Both parameters will be strings ranging in length from 1 to 50 characters and all of K's characters will exist somewhere in the string N. Both strings will only contains lowercase alphabetic characters.
Examples
Input: ["ahffaksfajeeubsne", "jefaa"]
Output: aksfaje
Input: ["aaffhkksemckelloe", "fhea"]
Output: affhkkse

Python 3  code:

def MinWindowSubstring(strArr):
    N, K = strArr
    freq = {}
    for c in K:
        freq[c] = freq.get(c, 0) + 1
    left, right = 0, 0
    seen = 0
    result = ""
    while right < len(N):
        if N[right] in freq:
            freq[N[right]] -= 1
            if freq[N[right]] >= 0:
                seen += 1
        while seen == len(K):
            if result == "" or right - left + 1 < len(result):
                result = N[left:right+1]
            if N[left] in freq:
                freq[N[left]] += 1
                if freq[N[left]] > 0:
                    seen -= 1
            left += 1
        right += 1
    return result
  # code goes here
    return strArr

# keep this function call here 
print(MinWindowSubstring(input()))
